# IoT4Kids

## 📘 Project Overview
**IoT4Kids** is an educational initiative funded by the Alumni Engagement Innovation Fund (AEIF) of the U.S. Department of State.  
Its mission is to **inspire and educate children** in Honduras through the **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Computer Science**, with a vision of creating equal opportunities and pathways to scholarships in STEM.  

Key achievements:
- Established the **IoT4Kids Lab** in Copán Ruinas with 30 Raspberry Pi 5 units, monitors, and Honduras’s first **FarmBot**.  
- Designed and deployed a **novel K-12 IoT/CS curriculum**, inspired by Harvard’s CS50, MIT Scratch, and Raspberry Pi Foundation materials.  
- Trained **60+ professionals** (teachers, engineers, physicians, educators) in IoT and Computer Science.  
- Directly impacted **600+ individuals** across 8+ regions.  
- Implemented a **Mobile IoT4Kids Lab** to reach rural communities.  
- Launched a **scholarship program** for outstanding students.  
- Recognized nationally as a **finalist in Proyectando Honduras** and presented internationally to universities such as Purdue University and St. John’s University.

## Technological Hub
Nestled in the verdant landscapes of western Honduras, Copán Ruinas is a town steeped in the rich history of the ancient Maya civilization. Renowned worldwide for its archaeological site, which features impressive ruins and an extensive collection of pre-Columbian artifacts, Copán Ruinas attracts scholars, historians, and tourists eager to delve into its storied past. The region is also famous for its coffee production, with local businesses cultivating and exporting some of the finest coffee beans, adding to the town's vibrant economy. Soon, it will also attract information technologists and expose cutting-edge technologies in rural areas.


The convergence of historical depth, thriving coffee industry, and IoT4Kids makes Copán Ruinas a unique and exciting locale for tourism and education. As we foster this blend of the past, present, and future, we invite visitors and potential partners to join us in shaping a new identity for Copán Ruinas, where technology and heritage create a vibrant, sustainable community.
