# IoT4Kids

## üìò Project Overview
**IoT4Kids** is an educational initiative funded by the Alumni Engagement Innovation Fund (AEIF) of the U.S. Department of State.  
Its mission is to **inspire and educate underrepresented children** in Honduras through the **Internet of Things (IoT)** and **Computer Science**, with a vision of creating equal opportunities and pathways to scholarships in STEM.  

Key achievements:
- Established the **IoT4Kids Lab** in Cop√°n Ruinas with 30 Raspberry Pi 5 units, monitors, and Honduras‚Äôs first **FarmBot**.  
- Designed and deployed a **novel K-12 IoT/CS curriculum**, inspired by Harvard‚Äôs CS50, MIT Scratch, and Raspberry Pi Foundation materials.  
- Trained **60+ professionals** (teachers, engineers, physicians, educators) in IoT and Computer Science.  
- Directly impacted **600+ individuals** across 8+ regions.  
- Implemented a **Mobile IoT4Kids Lab** to reach rural communities.  
- Launched a **scholarship program** for outstanding students.  
- Recognized nationally as a **finalist in Proyectando Honduras** and presented internationally to universities such as Purdue University and St. John‚Äôs University.
